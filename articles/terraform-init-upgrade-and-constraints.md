# terraform init -upgrade and Version Constraints

## Overview

`terraform init -upgrade` tells Terraform to ignore the versions pinned in `.terraform.lock.hcl` and resolve providers and modules again — selecting the newest versions that still satisfy your version constraints. Without `-upgrade`, `terraform init` respects whatever is already locked and only downloads what's missing.

Understanding when to use `-upgrade` and how to write effective version constraints keeps your infrastructure reproducible while still allowing controlled updates.


## What terraform init Does Normally

A plain `terraform init`:

1. Reads `.terraform.lock.hcl` to determine exact provider versions and hashes
2. Downloads any providers or modules not already cached in `.terraform/`
3. Initializes the backend

It will **never** change a locked version. If your lock file says `aws = 5.40.0`, init downloads exactly that, even if `5.60.0` is available.


## What -upgrade Changes

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

With `-upgrade`, Terraform:

1. Ignores the existing `.terraform.lock.hcl` entries
2. Re-resolves all providers and modules against the declared constraints
3. Selects the **newest** version satisfying each constraint
4. Updates `.terraform.lock.hcl` with the new versions and hashes
5. Downloads the new provider binaries and module sources

Think of it like `npm update` vs `npm install` — one resolves fresh, the other installs what's locked.


## When to Use -upgrade

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| You want newer provider versions | Pull latest within your constraints |
| A provider bug was fixed upstream | Get the patch without manually editing the lock file |
| You changed version constraints in `.tf` files | The lock file still has the old version; `-upgrade` resolves the new constraint |
| Module source changed or a new version was published | Modules are re-fetched from registries/git |
| CI is building against stale cached providers | Force fresh resolution to match current constraints |
| You're auditing what's available | See what Terraform would select today |

### When NOT to use -upgrade

- Normal day-to-day `plan`/`apply` — you want deterministic, locked versions
- In production CI pipelines without review — upgrades can introduce breaking changes
- When you haven't tested the newer version locally first


## Version Constraint Syntax

Terraform uses a constraint syntax for providers and modules that's similar to other package managers but has its own specifics.

### Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `=` | Exact version (default if no operator) | `= 5.40.0` |
| `!=` | Exclude a version | `!= 5.41.0` |
| `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` | Comparison | `>= 5.0.0` |
| `~>` | Pessimistic constraint (most common) | `~> 5.40` |

### The ~> (Pessimistic) Operator

This is the operator you'll use most. It allows only the **rightmost** version component to increment:

| Constraint | Allows | Does NOT allow |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| `~> 5.40` | `5.40.x`, `5.41.x`, `5.99.x` | `6.0.0` |
| `~> 5.40.0` | `5.40.0`, `5.40.1`, `5.40.99` | `5.41.0` |
| `~> 3.0` | `3.0.x`, `3.1.x`, `3.99.x` | `4.0.0` |

The difference between `~> 5.40` and `~> 5.40.0` is significant:
- `~> 5.40` = any `5.x` where `x >= 40` (allows minor bumps)
- `~> 5.40.0` = only `5.40.x` (allows only patches)

### Combining Constraints

You can combine multiple constraints with a comma (logical AND):

```hcl
version = ">= 5.40.0, < 6.0.0"
```

This is equivalent to `~> 5.40` but more explicit.


## Where Constraints Are Declared

### Provider Constraints

In the `required_providers` block:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.40"
    }
    kubernetes = {
      source  = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
      version = ">= 2.25.0, < 3.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also add constraints in provider blocks (but `required_providers` is preferred):

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 5.40"  # Legacy style — use required_providers instead
  region  = "eu-central-1"
}
```

### Module Constraints

When calling a module from a registry:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 5.0"
  # ...
}
```

For git-sourced modules, constraints aren't supported — you pin with a `ref`:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/org/terraform-vpc.git?ref=v2.1.0"
}
```

### Terraform Core Constraint

Pin the Terraform CLI version itself:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6.0, < 2.0.0"
}
```

This prevents running your config with an incompatible Terraform binary. Unlike providers, this isn't tracked in the lock file — it's checked at runtime.


## When to Configure Constraints

### Always constrain providers

Unconstrained providers default to "any version", which means:
- `terraform init -upgrade` could jump from `5.x` to `6.x` (major breaking change)
- Different team members could resolve different versions
- CI builds become non-deterministic

### Recommended constraint strategies

| Situation | Recommended Constraint | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| Stable production | `~> 5.40.0` (patch only) | Minimize risk, patches are usually safe |
| Active development | `~> 5.40` (minor + patch) | Get new features/resources, minors are backward-compatible |
| Experimental / greenfield | `>= 5.0.0, < 6.0.0` | Maximum flexibility within a major version |
| Shared module (published) | `>= 5.0.0` (wide range) | Don't force consumers into narrow ranges |
| Pinned for compliance | `= 5.40.0` (exact) | Audited version only, no drift |

### When to tighten constraints

- After a provider release broke your infrastructure
- When operating under compliance/audit requirements
- When a team is large and you need everyone on the same page
- In modules consumed by many teams (avoid cascading breakage)

### When to loosen constraints

- A resource or feature you need was added in a newer version
- Security patches are being published and you want them automatically
- You're the sole consumer and can validate quickly


## The Lock File (.terraform.lock.hcl)

The lock file is the actual enforcement mechanism. Constraints define _what's allowed_; the lock file records _what was chosen_.

```hcl
# .terraform.lock.hcl (auto-generated, do not edit manually)
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
  version     = "5.46.0"
  constraints = "~> 5.40"
  hashes = [
    "h1:abc123...",
    "zh:def456...",
  ]
}
```

Key facts:
- **Commit this file** to version control
- It records the `constraints` that were active when the version was selected
- It stores cryptographic hashes for integrity verification
- `terraform init` alone will never change it
- Only `terraform init -upgrade` (or `-lock=false`) will update it

### Hash formats

The lock file contains multiple hash types:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `h1:` | Hash of the zip archive (platform-independent) |
| `zh:` | Hash of individual files in the package (platform-specific) |

By default, Terraform only records hashes for your current platform. To support multiple platforms (common for teams with mixed OS):

```bash
terraform providers lock \
  -platform=linux_amd64 \
  -platform=darwin_arm64 \
  -platform=darwin_amd64
```


## Practical Workflows

### Controlled provider upgrade

```bash
# 1. Check what's currently locked
grep "version" .terraform.lock.hcl

# 2. Upgrade within constraints
terraform init -upgrade

# 3. Review what changed
git diff .terraform.lock.hcl

# 4. Run plan to check for issues
terraform plan

# 5. If everything looks good, commit the updated lock file
git add .terraform.lock.hcl
git commit -m "chore: upgrade providers within constraints"
```

### Upgrading past your current constraint

```bash
# 1. Update the constraint in your .tf file
#    version = "~> 5.40" → version = "~> 5.50"

# 2. Run init -upgrade to resolve the new constraint
terraform init -upgrade

# 3. Check the changelog for breaking changes between 5.40 and 5.50

# 4. Plan and review
terraform plan

# 5. Commit both the .tf change and the lock file
git add main.tf .terraform.lock.hcl
git commit -m "chore: upgrade AWS provider to ~> 5.50"
```

### Upgrading a single provider (without touching others)

Terraform doesn't have a built-in flag to upgrade only one provider, but you can:

```bash
# Option 1: Temporarily tighten other providers to exact versions
# (tedious, not recommended)

# Option 2: Upgrade all, then revert what you don't want
terraform init -upgrade
git checkout -- .terraform.lock.hcl  # revert all
# Manually edit lock file to keep only the provider you want upgraded
# (also tedious)

# Option 3 (recommended): Just upgrade all within constraints
# If your constraints are well-configured, upgrading all is safe
terraform init -upgrade
```

Since constraints protect you from major version jumps, upgrading everything within constraints is usually the correct approach. If you're nervous, review `git diff .terraform.lock.hcl` before committing.

### CI/CD pipeline pattern

```bash
# CI should NOT use -upgrade unless it's a dedicated "dependency update" job
# Normal CI:
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

# Dedicated dependency update job (weekly/scheduled):
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan -out=tfplan
# Review plan output, create PR with updated lock file
```


## Module Upgrades

Modules behave differently from providers during `-upgrade`:

- **Registry modules** — `-upgrade` re-fetches the latest version matching your constraint
- **Git modules** — The `ref` is fixed; `-upgrade` re-clones but the version doesn't change unless you update the `ref`
- **Local modules** (source = `"./modules/foo"`) — Always read fresh from disk, `-upgrade` has no effect

### Module version constraints vs provider constraints

| Aspect | Providers | Modules |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Locked in `.terraform.lock.hcl` | Yes | No |
| Cached in `.terraform/` | Yes (binaries) | Yes (source code) |
| `-upgrade` re-resolves | Yes | Yes |
| Deterministic without lock | No | No (for registry modules) |

This means **module versions are not locked** in `.terraform.lock.hcl`. Every `terraform init` (with or without `-upgrade`) will fetch the latest module version matching the constraint — unless the source is already cached in `.terraform/modules/`.

To get deterministic module versions:
- Use exact constraints: `version = "5.2.0"`
- Or rely on the cached `.terraform/modules/` directory (fragile)
- Or use git refs for source: `?ref=v5.2.0`


## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting to commit the lock file after -upgrade

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
# ... test locally, everything works ...
# Push code without .terraform.lock.hcl
# CI runs `terraform init` — gets a DIFFERENT version than you tested
```

Always commit `.terraform.lock.hcl` after upgrading.

### 2. Using -upgrade in production CI without review

```yaml
# BAD: CI auto-upgrades on every run
- run: terraform init -upgrade
- run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This means every CI run could pick up a new provider version. Upgrades should be deliberate, reviewed, and tested.

### 3. Overly loose constraints

```hcl
aws = {
  source  = "hashicorp/aws"
  version = ">= 4.0.0"  # Allows 4.x AND 5.x — major version jump!
}
```

When you eventually run `-upgrade`, you might jump from `4.67` to `5.46`, hitting breaking changes.

### 4. Overly tight constraints in shared modules

```hcl
# In a published module:
aws = {
  source  = "hashicorp/aws"
  version = "= 5.40.0"  # Forces ALL consumers to use exactly this version
}
```

This creates conflicts when consumers use different provider versions. Shared modules should use wide constraints (`>= 5.0.0`).

### 5. Not constraining the Terraform CLI version

```hcl
# Without this, someone with Terraform 0.12 could run your 1.6+ config
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6.0"
}
```

New syntax features, state format changes, and provider protocol versions can all break if the wrong Terraform binary is used.

### 6. Assuming -upgrade only affects providers

`-upgrade` also re-fetches modules. If you have a module constraint like `~> 5.0` and a new minor was published, it will be pulled in — potentially changing resource configurations.


## Relationship Between Constraints, Lock File, and -upgrade

                 │
                 │  terraform init -upgrade

```


## TL;DR

- `terraform init` = install what's locked, never upgrade
- `terraform init -upgrade` = re-resolve versions within constraints, update the lock file
- `~> 5.40` = allow `5.40+` but not `6.0` (most common constraint)
- `~> 5.40.0` = allow only patches (`5.40.x`)
- Always commit `.terraform.lock.hcl`
- Use `-upgrade` deliberately, not routinely
- Tighten constraints for stability, loosen for flexibility
- Constrain providers, modules, AND the Terraform CLI version
- Module versions are NOT locked in `.terraform.lock.hcl` — pin them with exact versions or git refs
