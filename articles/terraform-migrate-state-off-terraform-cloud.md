# Migrating State Off Terraform Cloud

## Overview

Terraform Cloud (TFC) stores state data remotely in its workspaces. If you need to migrate away from TFC to another backend — whether local, S3, Azure Storage, or GCS — you'll find that `terraform init` won't handle the migration automatically. As of current versions, Terraform does not support direct state migration from the `cloud` backend to another backend. This article walks through the manual process.

## The Problem

When you try the standard migration approach (update backend config, run `terraform init`), Terraform returns an error:

```
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Migrating from Terraform Cloud to backend "azurerm".

```

This happens regardless of whether you're migrating to local, S3, azurerm, GCS, or any other backend. You need to perform the migration manually.

## How Local State and Workspaces Work

Before migrating, it helps to understand how Terraform organizes state data locally:

- **Default workspace** — state lives in `terraform.tfstate` in the configuration directory
- **Non-default workspaces** — each workspace gets a subdirectory under `terraform.tfstate.d/` (created when you create the first non-default workspace)
- **Active workspace** — tracked in `.terraform/environment` (a single line with the workspace name; `terraform workspace select` simply changes this entry)
- **Workspace listing** — `terraform workspace list` reads subdirectories inside `terraform.tfstate.d` and adds the default workspace automatically
- **Backend reference** — stored in `.terraform/terraform.tfstate`

Example directory structure with `development` and `production` workspaces:

```
.
├── terraform.tfstate.d/
│   ├── development/
│   │   └── terraform.tfstate
│   └── production/
│       └── terraform.tfstate
└── .terraform/
    ├── environment           # Contains the active workspace name
    └── terraform.tfstate     # Backend configuration reference
```

## Migrating to the Local Backend

### Steps

1. Pull state data from Terraform Cloud
2. Create the local workspace directory structure
3. Remove the old backend reference
4. Update configuration to remove the `cloud` block
5. Run `terraform init`

### Single Workspace

```bash
# Create workspace directory
mkdir -p terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace-name>

# Pull state data from TFC and save locally
terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace-name>/terraform.tfstate

# Remove the backend reference that points to TFC
mv .terraform/terraform.tfstate .terraform/terraform.tfstate.old
```

Then remove the `cloud` block from your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Remove this entire block:
  # cloud {
  #   organization = "my-org"
  #   workspaces {
  #     name = "my-workspace"
  #   }
  # }
}
```

Finally, reinitialize:

```bash
terraform init
```

Verify with a plan:

```bash
terraform plan
# Should show no changes if migration was successful
```

### Multiple Workspaces

If you have multiple TFC workspaces using the same configuration, repeat the state pull for each:

```bash
mkdir -p terraform.tfstate.d/development
mkdir -p terraform.tfstate.d/production

# Switch to each workspace and pull its state
terraform workspace select development
terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate.d/development/terraform.tfstate

terraform workspace select production
terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate.d/production/terraform.tfstate

# Clean up and reinitialize
mv .terraform/terraform.tfstate .terraform/terraform.tfstate.old
# Remove cloud block from config
terraform init
```

## Migrating to a Remote Backend (S3, AzureRM, GCS)

The process is similar — you pull state from TFC and upload it to the new backend manually.

### Migrating to S3

```bash
# Pull state from TFC
terraform state pull > statedata

# Upload to S3 (adjust key for workspace naming convention)
aws s3 cp statedata s3://my-terraform-state/prod/terraform.tfstate

# Remove old backend reference
mv .terraform/terraform.tfstate .terraform/terraform.tfstate.old
```

Update configuration — remove `cloud` block, add S3 backend:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

Reinitialize:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
# Should show no changes
```

### Migrating to AzureRM

The `azurerm` backend names workspace blobs by appending `env:<workspace-name>` to the key. For example, with `key = "webapp"` and workspace `production`, the blob name is `webappenv:production`.

```bash
# Pull state from TFC
terraform state pull > statedata

# Upload to Azure Storage
az storage blob upload \
  --account-name mystorageaccount \
  --container-name terraform-state \
  --name "webappenv:production" \
  --file statedata

# Remove old backend reference
mv .terraform/terraform.tfstate .terraform/terraform.tfstate.old
```

Update configuration — remove `cloud` block, add azurerm backend:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-rg"
    storage_account_name = "mystorageaccount"
    container_name       = "terraform-state"
    key                  = "webapp"
  }
}
```

Reinitialize:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
```

### Migrating to GCS

```bash
# Pull state from TFC
terraform state pull > statedata

# Upload to GCS
gsutil cp statedata gs://my-terraform-state/prod/default.tfstate

# Remove old backend reference
mv .terraform/terraform.tfstate .terraform/terraform.tfstate.old
```

Update configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    prefix = "prod"
  }
}
```

Reinitialize:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
```

## Two-Stage Migration (Alternative Approach)

If you're unsure about the workspace naming conventions of your target backend, a safer approach is:

1. Migrate from TFC → local (as described above)
2. Migrate from local → target backend using `terraform init -migrate-state`

The second step uses Terraform's built-in migration, which handles workspace layout automatically:

```bash
# After successfully migrating to local:
# Update backend config to target (e.g., S3)
terraform init -migrate-state
```

This avoids having to manually name blobs/keys in the target backend's workspace format.

## Verifying the Migration

After migration, always verify:

```bash
# Check state is accessible
terraform state list

# Confirm no unexpected changes
terraform plan

# Verify workspace (if applicable)
terraform workspace show
```

If `terraform plan` shows no changes, the migration was successful. If it wants to recreate resources, something went wrong with the state data — restore from your backup and retry.

## Common Issues

### "Backend configuration changed" Error

If you get prompted about backend changes during `terraform init`, answer `yes` to reinitialize. If you get an error about migrating from cloud, you missed the step of removing `.terraform/terraform.tfstate`.

### State Serial Number Conflicts

If uploading state to a backend that already has state data, the serial numbers may conflict. Make sure the target location is empty before uploading.

### Workspace Not Found After Migration

If `terraform workspace list` doesn't show your workspace after migrating to local, check that:
- The directory exists under `terraform.tfstate.d/`
- The directory name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- The `terraform.tfstate` file exists inside it

## Summary

| Step | Local Backend | Remote Backend (S3/Azure/GCS) |
|------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1. Pull state | `terraform state pull > ...` | `terraform state pull > statedata` |
| 2. Store state | Save to `terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace>/terraform.tfstate` | Upload to target (aws s3 cp / az storage / gsutil) |
| 3. Clean backend ref | `mv .terraform/terraform.tfstate .terraform/terraform.tfstate.old` | Same |
| 4. Update config | Remove `cloud` block | Remove `cloud` block, add new backend |
| 5. Reinitialize | `terraform init` | `terraform init` |
| 6. Verify | `terraform plan` | `terraform plan` |

The key insight: `terraform state pull` works regardless of backend — it fetches the current state from wherever it's stored. Combined with manual upload to the new backend and a clean reinitialization, you can migrate off Terraform Cloud to any backend.
