# terraform get -update vs terraform init -upgrade

## Overview

Both commands refresh module sources, but they operate at different scopes and serve different purposes. Confusing them — or using one when you need the other — leads to stale modules, unexpected provider changes, or wasted time re-downloading things you didn't intend to touch.

---

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | `terraform get -update` | `terraform init -upgrade` |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Scope | Modules only | Modules + Providers + Backend |
| Updates providers | No | Yes |
| Updates modules | Yes | Yes |
| Updates `.terraform.lock.hcl` | No | Yes (provider entries) |
| Initializes backend | No | Yes |
| Can be run without a backend configured | Yes | No (fails if backend is misconfigured) |
| Typical use case | Refresh module source code | Full dependency upgrade |

---

## terraform get

`terraform get` downloads and updates module source code into `.terraform/modules/`. That's all it does — nothing else.

```bash
# Download modules (only if not already cached)
terraform get

# Force re-download even if already cached
terraform get -update
```

### What it touches

```
.terraform/
├── modules/           ← terraform get operates HERE
│   ├── modules.json   ← manifest mapping module calls to local paths
│   └── vpc/           ← downloaded module source
└── providers/         ← NOT touched by terraform get
```

### When -update matters

Without `-update`, `terraform get` only downloads modules that are missing from the cache. If the module source already exists in `.terraform/modules/`, it's skipped — even if a newer version is available.

With `-update`, Terraform re-fetches all modules regardless of what's cached:

- Registry modules: resolves the latest version matching the constraint
- Git modules: re-clones at the specified `ref`
- HTTP/S3 archives: re-downloads the archive
- Local modules: no effect (always read from disk)

### What it does NOT do

- Does not touch providers
- Does not update `.terraform.lock.hcl`
- Does not initialize or reconfigure the backend
- Does not validate provider requirements

---

## terraform init -upgrade

`terraform init -upgrade` is a superset that covers everything `terraform get -update` does plus providers and backend initialization.

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

### What it touches

```
.terraform/
├── modules/           ← re-fetched (same as get -update)
│   ├── modules.json
│   └── vpc/
├── providers/         ← re-resolved and re-downloaded
│   └── registry.terraform.io/
│       └── hashicorp/aws/5.50.0/
├── terraform.tfstate  ← backend cache (re-initialized)
└── environment        ← workspace metadata

.terraform.lock.hcl    ← UPDATED with new provider versions/hashes
```

### The full sequence

1. Initialize/verify backend configuration
2. Re-resolve provider versions within declared constraints
3. Download new provider binaries
4. Update `.terraform.lock.hcl` with new versions and hashes
5. Re-fetch all modules (same behavior as `get -update`)

---

## When to Use Which

### Use terraform get -update when:

- You updated a module's source code (pushed a new commit to a git ref you're tracking)
- You want to refresh modules without risking provider version changes
- You're iterating on a module locally referenced via git and want the latest
- Your backend is broken/misconfigured and you just need fresh modules to work on
- You want a fast operation that doesn't re-resolve providers (faster in large projects)

### Use terraform init -upgrade when:

- You want to upgrade both providers and modules
- You changed provider version constraints and need to re-resolve
- You need a full re-initialization (backend + providers + modules)
- You're doing a scheduled dependency update
- A new provider version has a fix you need

### Use plain terraform init when:

- You cloned the repo and need to set up the working directory
- You want to install exactly what's locked (deterministic)
- Normal day-to-day workflow before `plan`/`apply`

---

## Behavior with Different Module Sources

| Module Source | `get -update` | `init -upgrade` |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Registry (`terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`) | Re-resolves version constraint | Same |
| Git with tag (`?ref=v2.1.0`) | Re-clones at same tag | Same |
| Git with branch (`?ref=main`) | Re-clones latest commit on branch | Same |
| Git without ref | Re-clones default branch HEAD | Same |
| Local path (`./modules/foo`) | No effect (always fresh) | No effect |
| HTTP archive | Re-downloads | Same |

For module handling, the two commands are identical. The difference is everything else `init -upgrade` does on top.

---

## Provider Handling: The Key Difference

This is where the two commands diverge completely.

### terraform get -update

```bash
terraform get -update
# Providers: untouched
# .terraform.lock.hcl: untouched
# Backend: untouched
# Modules: re-fetched
```

Your provider versions stay exactly where they were. The lock file doesn't change. If you had `aws = 5.40.0` locked, you still have `aws = 5.40.0` after running this.

### terraform init -upgrade

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
# Providers: re-resolved (may change versions!)
# .terraform.lock.hcl: updated
# Backend: re-initialized
# Modules: re-fetched
```

If your constraint says `~> 5.40` and `5.50.0` was released since your last lock, you'll now have `5.50.0`. The lock file is rewritten.

---

## Performance Differences

In large projects with many providers (AWS provider alone is ~400MB), the distinction matters:

| Command | Time (typical large project) | Network | Disk writes |
|---------|------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `terraform get -update` | 5–30 seconds | Module sources only | `.terraform/modules/` |
| `terraform init -upgrade` | 30–120+ seconds | Modules + provider binaries | `.terraform/modules/` + `.terraform/providers/` + lock file |
| `terraform init` (no upgrade) | 5–15 seconds | Only missing items | Minimal |

If you only need fresh modules, `get -update` avoids downloading hundreds of megabytes of provider binaries.

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You pushed a fix to a shared module

Your config references a git module:

```hcl
module "networking" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/org/terraform-networking.git?ref=main"
}
```

You pushed a fix to `main`. You want to pick it up:

```bash
# Fast, targeted — only refreshes modules
terraform get -update

# Then plan/apply as normal
terraform plan
```

No need for `init -upgrade` here — providers haven't changed.

### Scenario 2: New provider version fixes a bug

The AWS provider `5.50.0` fixed a bug you're hitting. Your constraint is `~> 5.40`:

```bash
# You need init -upgrade because you want a new provider version
terraform init -upgrade

# Verify the version changed
grep "aws" .terraform.lock.hcl

# Plan to ensure nothing unexpected
terraform plan

# Commit the lock file
git add .terraform.lock.hcl && git commit -m "chore: upgrade AWS provider"
```

`terraform get -update` would not help here — it doesn't touch providers.

### Scenario 3: Both module and provider need updating

You bumped a module version constraint AND a provider constraint:

```bash
# init -upgrade handles both in one command
terraform init -upgrade
```

There's no advantage to running `get -update` separately in this case.

### Scenario 4: CI pipeline — module changed but providers must stay pinned

```bash
# Refresh modules without risking provider drift
terraform get -update

# Then normal init (installs locked providers, doesn't re-resolve)
terraform init

# Plan and apply
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

This pattern ensures modules are fresh while providers remain at their locked versions.

---

## Edge Cases and Gotchas

### 1. terraform get doesn't validate provider requirements

If a new module version requires a provider you haven't declared (or a newer version than you have locked), `terraform get -update` won't warn you. You'll only discover the problem at `plan` time:

```
Error: Missing required provider
```

`terraform init -upgrade` catches this because it re-resolves the full dependency tree.

### 2. terraform get after init -upgrade is redundant

Since `init -upgrade` already re-fetches modules, running `get -update` afterward does nothing useful.

### 3. terraform get works without a configured backend

This is actually useful when you're working on module development and don't have (or need) a backend:

```bash
# Backend is misconfigured or you're in a module-only workspace
terraform get -update  # Works fine
terraform init         # Would fail due to backend issues
```

### 4. Neither command updates local modules

Local path modules (`source = "./modules/foo"`) are always read directly from disk. Neither `get -update` nor `init -upgrade` copies or caches them — they're used in place.

### 5. Module versions aren't in the lock file

Even after `init -upgrade`, module versions are not recorded in `.terraform.lock.hcl`. Only providers are locked. This means:

- `terraform get -update` and `terraform init -upgrade` can both silently pick up new module versions
- For deterministic module versions, use exact version constraints or git refs with specific tags/commits

## TL;DR

- `terraform get -update` = refresh module source code only (fast, safe, no provider/lock changes)
- `terraform init -upgrade` = refresh everything — modules, providers, lock file, backend (slower, changes versions)
- Use `get -update` when you only care about modules and want to leave providers untouched
- Use `init -upgrade` when you want to pull newer provider versions within your constraints
- `init -upgrade` is a superset of `get -update` — it does everything `get -update` does plus more
- Neither command locks module versions — only providers are locked in `.terraform.lock.hcl`
- In CI, prefer `get -update` + `init` over `init -upgrade` to keep provider versions deterministic
